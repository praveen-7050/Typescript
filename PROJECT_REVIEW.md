## 🔍 Detailed Technical Review

### 1. Architecture & State Management

The project follows a clean, modular structure that separates concerns effectively:

- **Global State:** Uses `React Context` API via `CartContext` and `ThemeContext`. This avoids "prop drilling" and ensures that cart data and theme preferences are accessible anywhere in the app.
- **Component Design:** Components are built with `React.FC` and utilize `useCallback` for performance optimization, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
  - `Navbar`: Handles navigation and theme toggling.
  - `CartDrawer`: A side-panel for cart management.
  - `OrderConfirmation`: A dedicated UI for successful purchases.
  - `Toast`: Lightweight notifications for user feedback.

### 2. UI/UX Design (Aesthetics)

- **Modern Styling:** Powered by **Tailwind CSS 4**, utilizing modern CSS features for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully adaptive layout that works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Interactivity:** Smooth transitions (e.g., `transition-colors duration-300`) and interactive elements provide a premium, "app-like" feel.
- **Dark Mode:** A native dark mode implementation is included, reflecting modern design trends.

### 3. Developer Experience (DX)

- **TypeScript:** Strict typing across the codebase (e.g., `interface Product`, `interface ToastItem`) reduces bugs and improves IDE autocomplete.
- **Vite:** Leveraging Vite 7 ensures near-instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and extremely fast build times.
- **ESLint/Prettier:** Configured with modern rules (`eslint.config.js`) to maintain code quality and consistency.

### 4. Code Quality & Performance

- **Zero Placeholders:** The project uses real data types and logic instead of dummy placeholders.
- **Optimization:** Use of `useCallback` in `App.tsx` shows attention to detail in React performance.
- **SEO Ready:** Semantic HTML used throughout to ensure better indexing.

### 5. Deployment & Hosting

- **Vercel Config:** The inclusion of `vercel.json` with rewrite rules ensures that client-side routing works perfectly in production without 404 errors.

### 6. Recommendations for Future Improvements

- **Backend Integration:** Currently, state is managed locally. Integrating a backend (e.g., Supabase or Firebase) for persistent user data and real orders would be the next step.
- **Unit Testing:** Adding Vitest or Jest would increase the reliability of the core cart logic.
- **Image Optimization:** Implementing a CDN for product images if the catalog grows significantly.
